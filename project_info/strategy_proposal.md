# BURGr Community Data Projects: Strategy Proposal 2017

Dear BURGr Community,

Much discussion was partaken of at the openning meeting of 2017 regarding the concept of data projects that would run during the course of the year and that could be explored by members, whether collaboratively or individually. 

## Outline

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Guidelines](#guidelines)
* [Resources](#resources)

## <a name='overview'></a>Overview

The basic goal of this idea is that BURGr is a Data Science focused Meetup group with a particular focus in the use of the R programming language. As a result, it would be a natural direction to involve members in data analysis such that members can:

* freely learn from each other in a relational context (i.e. while getting to know each other)
* immediately practice the skills and ideas that they acquire from presentations and other interactions. 
    * If the community datasets serve as a suitable aid, presenters have the option (not obligation) to use them as a case study to demonstrate the ideas that they wish to convey.
    * this would have the immediate benefit of enabling users to master said concepts more easily.
* serve as a platform for users to gain exposure to datasets and techniques that they can translate, via the community projects, to their respective roles, whether industry or academic.

Essentially, these projects will serve as a "smooth beverage" with which members can enjoy their BURGr experience :smile:

## <a name='guidelines'></a>Guidelines

This proposal is that a reasonably small selection of datasets or groups of datasets be selected and ratified by the group. Selection of such a set could be via some form of voting mechanism (e.g secret ballot or online poll). Alternatively, the decision making progress can be delegated to a representative sample of the group, who would have to presumably have to rationalise such a decision.

It is recommended that, like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), which caters for inexperienced users via its [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) tutorial competition, the shortlist of diffferent projects of differing complexity. This would have the advantage of encouraging newer users to relish the data challenge and "pick up the BURGr" (get their hands dirty), while satisfying the appetites of more seasoned connoisseurs. Thus, catering simultaneously for members at multiple skill levels to maximise both interest and learning outcomes.

To serve the goals stated [above](#overview) the BURGr community datasets would be drawn from different domains that are conceptually accessible to all members. This would serve to maximise engagement by:

1. Broadening the audience who benefits by making the analysis more easily accessible. Members should not have to invest a lot of effort to understand the background and meaning of the dataset, but should focus on applying data science techniques to 
2. This in turn makes it easier for members to transfer group learning iutcomes to their own projects andd domains through the similarities that they observe.
3. Allows the group to simultaneously tackle different kinds of data analysys problems simultaneously, thus serving the above objectives.
